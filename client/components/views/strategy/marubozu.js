            <p>A Marubozu is the polar opposite of a Doji. Its opening price and closing price are at the extreme ends of the candlestick.</p>
            <p>Visually, it is a block.</p>

            <p><strong>What does it mean?</strong></p>
            <p>A Marubozu that closes higher signifies powerful&nbsp;bullish strength while one that closes lower shows&nbsp;extreme bearishness.</p>
            <p><strong>How do we trade it?</strong></p>
            <p>The Marubozu is more useful as a learning tool than as a pattern for trading. Together with the Doji candlestick, they highlight the extremes of the candlestick spectrum.</p>
